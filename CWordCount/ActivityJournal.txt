Start
Estimated Time	01:00
Plan:
(Order of implementation, testing approach, etc.)
* Make a loop that takes in one char at a time until EOF
* Add 1 to total chars at start of loop
* Create print statement outside of loop to see results
- Check output
* If the char is a newline, add 1 to total lines
- Check output
* Create a 'boolean' for in_word, set to 0
* If newline is detected, add 1 to total words if in_word and reset in_word
to 0 to allow for multiple newlines in a row
* Detect if the char is a space and do the same: add 1 to total words if
in_word and reset in_word
* Set in_word to 1 overall
- Check output

Complete
Actual Time	00:51
Observations:
(Lessons learned, problems encountered, obstacles overcome, etc.)
* At first, I my number of words was too high. I realized I needed to wrap my
in_word = 1 line in an else statement whch made the program more logical and
fixed my issue.
* I had to mess with the formatting of my print statement to get one space
before 11, two before 64, and one before 375 to match the assignment. I did
this with whitespace padding in my formatting.
