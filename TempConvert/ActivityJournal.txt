================================================================
Start Part 1
Estimated Time	00:30
Plan:
(Order of implementation, testing approach, etc.)
* print chart label
* use a loop with increments of 20
- for loop prints the loop variable and the converted C using a formatted line
* test that output is successful and formatted nicely

Complete
Actual Time	00:23
Observations:
(Lessons learned, problems encountered, obstacles overcome, etc.)
* don't forget the double quotes in a printf statement
* pay attention to truncation when doing math with integers
* I had to reference the slideshow since I've never worked with C before and we
haven't covered it in class yet
* I had to edit my vimrc because my tabs were quite large
* My formatted '\t' was too large to match the example so I used padding instead
* I compiled it 8 times: the first were syntactical mistakes and the rest was
messing with formatting
