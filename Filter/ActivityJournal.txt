Start
Estimated Time	01:00
Plan:
(Order of implementation, testing approach, etc.)
* Complete one function at a time, in order
* Make sure to use copies of pointers to keep starting positions
* Comment my plan out before writing the function
* Use valgrind and -fsanitize to look at memory allocation issues

Complete
Actual Time	01:20
Observations:
(Lessons learned, problems encountered, obstacles overcome, etc.)
* pay attention to the math when using realloc()
* look closely to avoid off-by-one errors
* make a commented plan and then simplify it from the start before adding the code in
