Name: Kayla Van Bortel

================================================================
Implement code to pass all unit tests

Estimated Time	01:00
Plan:
(Order of implementation, testing approach, etc.)
* Read over instructions
* Implement get_field() by looping to get next_char until MAX_CHARS
- break if the next char is the end of the field
- add chars to the field
- end the field with a null terminator
* Implement get_line() by using get_field on line.field[i] until the end of the line,
increment nfields
* Implement print_csv() with a loop using min() and the indexes of the header and data fields
* Run the unit tests
* Compile/Debug throughout

Complete
Actual Time	02:00
Observations:
(Lessons learned, problems encountered, obstacles overcome, etc.)
* Figured out structs and typedefs work
* Had to look very closely at the csv.h file


================================================================
