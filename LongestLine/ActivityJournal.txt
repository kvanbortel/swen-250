Part 1
Estimated Time	00:30
Plan:
(Order of implementation, testing approach, etc.)
* use a for loop to increment index and get the next char
* add break case if the char is \n
* if the index is within the array size, add the new char
* if it's the last index, use a null terminator and stop adding to s[]
* continue to count the length until EOF

Complete
Actual Time 00:24
Observations:
(Lessons learned, problems encountered, obstacles overcome, etc.)
* in class, we used getchar() in the for loop, but it was easier to
track what was happening when I moved it out
* I finnicked with comparing to MAXLINE to get the perfect char count for s[]
* don't forget semicolons


================================================================
Part 2
Estimated Time	00:30
Plan:
(Order of implementation, testing approach, etc.)
* create a helper function to find the size of an array
* loop through the arr based on helper function to copy it over
* compare new lines to "max" and only save arr if it's longer
* print longest

Complete
Actual Time	00:42
Observations:
(Lessons learned, problems encountered, obstacles overcome, etc.)
* I compiled twice with lots of easily fixed errors. Putting "[]" everywhere
is not how to pass in arrays. Semicolons are important. Declaring things in
proper places is also important.
* gcc does not like 4 spaces; it likes tabs
* I had to move my "max" declaration outside of the while loop. oops.
