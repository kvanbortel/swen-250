SWEN-250 Activity Reflection

Name: Kayla Van Bortel

================================================================
Start
Estimated Time	01:30
Plan:
(Order of implementation, testing approach, etc.)
* Implement one function at a time starting from the first one
* Use working pointers when necessary, incrementing then to move down the strings
* Get one function working before moving onto the next
* Pay attention to constraints for the different functions

Complete
Actual Time	00:55
Observations:
(Lessons learned, problems encountered, obstacles overcome, etc.)
* In the last function I had to take a closer look at my algorithm and saw where it had gone wrong
* Working pointers are useful
* Return p_str instead of *p_str
* Sometimes longer code for easier readability is better (especially with increments and decrements)
